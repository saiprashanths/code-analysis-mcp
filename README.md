# Code Analysis MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI models to understand and analyze codebases through natural language conversations.

## ‚ú® Highlights

- **Natural Code Exploration**: Ask high-level questions about your codebase
  ```
  "What are all the different payment providers integrated in the system?"
  ```

- **Deep Code Understanding**: Extract insights about data models and system architecture
  ```
  "How does the user authentication flow work from frontend to database?"
  ```

- **Dynamic Analysis**: Trace data flows and understand system relationships
  ```
  "Show me all the places where we calculate transaction fees"
  ```

## Limitations

This tool is a simpler alternative to more sophisticated code analysis tools / copilot like [Aider](https://aider.chat/). While it lacks the advanced code analysis capabilities and robustness of tools like Aider, it offers a lightweight solution for codebase exploration if you already have a Claude Pro subscription. The main advantages are:

- **Cost-Effective**: Using your existing Claude Pro subscription means no additional API costs, unlike tools that can get expensive when analyzing large codebases
- **Simple Setup**: Quick to get started with minimal configuration
- **Basic Analysis**: Good for high-level code understanding and exploration

Note that due to its simpler approach to code analysis, it may make more errors or provide less detailed insights compared to more specialized tools.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Install the server:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saiprashanths/code-analysis-mcp.git
cd code-analysis-mcp
```

2. Install [Claude Desktop App](https://claude.ai/download). For more instructions on setting up an MCP Server with Claude Desktop app, [see docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)

3. Configure the server in Claude Desktop's configuration file:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "code-analysis": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/PATH/TO/YOUR/REPO",
        "run",
        "code_analysis.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

4. Restart Claude Desktop and start analyzing your code!

5. Ensure the tool is correctly setup
- Clicking the tools icon should display the `code-analysis` tools

## üí° Example Usage

Here's how you might use the tool to understand a complex codebase:

Start by clicking on the `analyze_code_repository` prompt shown below. That will guide you through the process 
to initialize the repo and get started.

```text
You: How does the transaction processing work in this system?

Claude: Let me analyze the data flow for transactions. 
Looking at the codebase, I can see that transaction processing happens through several key components:

1. Raw transaction data is captured in the `TransactionEvent` model with fields for:
   - Payment status
   - Amount
   - Fee calculations
   - Processing timestamps

2. This data is then processed through the PaymentSummary model, which:
   - Validates payment provider responses
   - Calculates processing fees
   - Records transaction status

Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail?

You: What are the key database tables involved?

Claude: The main tables in the transaction processing pipeline are:

1. transaction_events: Stores raw payment events
2. payment_summary: Processed transaction records
3. payment_providers: Provider configuration
4. merchant_accounts: Account-specific settings

Let me know if you'd like to see the schema for any of these tables!
